                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world
                    due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly
                    developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the
                    population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no
                    required formal training for practitioners.[8]
                    <!-- In the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for
                    example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked
                    sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.[9] -->

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Delivering medicine from an online source to the patient can be done in several ways. Here are some common methods:</p><br>

                   <p> 1.Courier delivery: One of the most common ways to deliver medicine from an online source to the patient is through courier delivery. The medicine is packaged and shipped to the patient's address. This method is convenient for patients who cannot visit a pharmacy in person.</p>
                    
                   <p>2.Mail delivery: Another option is to use mail delivery services. In this case, the medicine is shipped to the patient's address via postal mail. This method may take longer than courier delivery but can be a cost-effective option.</p>
                    
                   <p>3.Online pharmacies: Online pharmacies are becoming increasingly popular and offer an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Patients can order medicine online and have it delivered directly to their doorstep.</p>
                    
                   <p>4.Mobile applications: Some companies are developing mobile applications that allow patients to order medicine online and have it delivered to their doorstep. These applications may also offer additional features such as prescription management and reminders.</p><br>
                    
                    When delivering medicine from an online source to the patient, it is important to ensure that the medication is packaged securely and that it is delivered to the correct address. It is also important to follow any relevant laws and regulations related to the delivery of medication.
